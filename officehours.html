				<p>Inspired by visuals of games in Playstation 1 era, <b>Office Hours</b> was developed for <a
						href="https://itch.io/jam/scream-jam-2020">Scream Jam 2020</a> on <a
						href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> in
					<b>10 days</b> with a dedicated team. Maintain your sanity while trying to escape the horrors of the
					office by closing your eyes, and not looking at anything that might want
					to get you!
				<p>Utilizing <b>C#</b> and <b>Unity Game Engine</b>, I developed the monster AI, the player's sanity
					system, as well as other components of the game. The AI was created based off
					a <b>finite state machine</b> that encompassed 3 primary states of patrolling, hunting, and
					searching. The patrolling was created based off predetermined nodes, similar to
					a <b>cyclic directed graph</b> that has directed edges to the next node, or destination. By
					utilizing Unity's <b>NavMesh, or Navigation Mesh</b> render meshes, the AI was able
					to pathfind and traverse the level freely, while avoiding any obstacles that would block its path.
					All art assets were created in <b>Blender</b>, and imported into Unity.</p>
