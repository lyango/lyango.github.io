				<p><b>Bawk To Work</b> is a solo project developed in Unity Game Engine. Help the chicken get back to work by collecting coffee, and 
				powerups to increase the score. The player naturally accumulates points over time, but the game will increase in speed the further 
				you get!
				<p>This game is an endless runner that incorporates randomly generated platforms, as well as randomly generated points and powerups 
				that the player can collect. This was done by creating a point of reference in tandem with game camera; once objects are off the camera, 
				then objects are disabled to generate new objects for the player. Utilizing the <b>object pool pattern</b> design pattern, I was able to 
				do this. Through this pattern, memory was saved by reusing the platforms, points, and powerups as a pool of initialized objects.</p>
                <p><b>Game design</b>, and <b>programming</b> were all done by me through Unity and C#. Some <b>art</b> was also created by me 
                by using pixel art programs. Most of the <b>art</b> was done by <a href="https://pixelfrog-store.itch.io/">Pixel Frog</a>, with
                <b>music</b> by <a href="http://nathanclearymusic.co.uk/">Nathan Cleary Music</a>.</p>
